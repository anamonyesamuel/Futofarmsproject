# Futofarmsproject
I used offline bootstrap, you might not be able to view it very well on the web, except u have an offline downloaded bootstrap. Then all the images were saved in a folder called 'img' if you check my html and css you will notice that. When u have downloaded this project save all the images in one folder and name it img.
